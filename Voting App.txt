1)Create required Deployments,Services and Pods

[root@ip-172-31-18-110 k8s-specifications]# kubectl apply -f .
deployment.apps/db created
service/db created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/result created
service/result created
deployment.apps/vote created
service/vote created
deployment.apps/worker created

2)Verify the pods running
[root@ip-172-31-18-110 k8s-specifications]# kubectl  get po
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-69cgj        1/1     Running   0          86s
redis-868d64d78-cfn44     1/1     Running   0          86s
result-5d57b59f4b-lxjw8   1/1     Running   0          86s
vote-94849dc97-wrjng      1/1     Running   0          85s
worker-dd46d7584-xcsml    1/1     Running   0          85s

3)Check the Ports details of result and vote app .
[root@ip-172-31-18-110 k8s-specifications]# kubectl  get svc
NAME     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
db       ClusterIP   10.108.218.236   <none>        5432/TCP         2m43s
redis    ClusterIP   10.100.152.113   <none>        6379/TCP         2m43s
result   NodePort    10.102.151.11    <none>        5001:31001/TCP   2m42s
vote     NodePort    10.105.28.66     <none>        5000:31000/TCP   2m42s

4) Use public Ip and Node port to view the vote and result app in web client(browser)

5)Deleting voting  or worker pod does not bring the application down as replica set is configured which immediately brings up the
respective pods and no or minimal impact is seen on the app.

6)Delete the Pod running the DB configurations
kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-69cgj

7)We can see that worker pod is restarted when DB pod is down.
worker-dd46d7584-nxjjv    1/1     Running       1          3m39s
[root@ip-172-31-18-110 k8s-specifications]# kubectl  get po
NAME                      READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-k9fd9        0/1     Terminating   0          13m
db-b54cd94f4-kt9tq        1/1     Running       0          41s
redis-868d64d78-cfn44     1/1     Running       0          20m
result-5d57b59f4b-pjhbb   1/1     Running       0          8m9s
vote-94849dc97-jbvw6      1/1     Running       0          6m54s
worker-dd46d7584-nxjjv    1/1     Running       1          3m42s

8)The result app will not work once the DB pod is down as in the current code
the socket connection in the result app to the DB side is synchronous and 
requires restarting the result pod also. Upon restart the result and vote apps work properly.

Either the application should be handled in such scenarios or this might impact other pods (result app here)
