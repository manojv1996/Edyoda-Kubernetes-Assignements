A daemon set is commonly used where each node in a cluster has to run a copy of pod.
In replica set this cannot be achieved always as the scheduler manages where the instance needs to be run
and there is no guarantee that a copy is run in all nodes.

Some common applications such as logging or some node monitoring operations can be achieved using daemon sets
