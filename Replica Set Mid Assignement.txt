The kind is ReplicationController for kubia-rc.yaml and ReplicaSet for kubia-replicaset.yaml

After running the ReplicaSet below command gives the details of the replicas running in the ReplicaSet
[root@ip-172-31-18-110 05-services]# kubectl get rs
NAME    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
kubia   3         3         3       10s

After running kubia-svc.yaml a pod running kubia app is picked
[root@ip-172-31-18-110 05-services]#  curl 10.99.10.99:80
You've hit kubia-ct6t7

Change label of pod kubia-ct67
kubectl label --overwrite po  kubia-ct6t7 app=kubia3

After changing the label another pod will be spanned by the ReplicaSet and since label does not match
service will not run on this pod
